C00000 is the VDP's base address

C00000 happens to be VDP data

but C00000 + 4 is C00004 :P
which is VDP_CTRL

8F02 is the value written to VDP_CTRL
a1 points to C00000, but 4(a1) points to C00004





move.w  #0x8F02,4(a1)           /* set INC to 2 */

^^ sets vdp auto increment to 2 ^^

so, when a word is written to VDP_DATA, the internal VDP address pointer increments by 2
which means it points to the next tile

no, not tile
table entry

well I meant entry referring to a tile
not tile graphics data



you check your X accumulator, and if it has reached 40, zero it out and add to Y
and do the address calculations that make sense
(also, any reason you aren't using VDP_DATA as a moniker for $C00000 and defining it at the top level?)

tst.b   (a0) is a waste though
can just test d0 and move to the vdp afterwards
or branch out
