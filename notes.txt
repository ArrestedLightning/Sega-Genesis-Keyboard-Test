Create 4 char buffers:


|  15 x 6   |   18 x 6  |

|        34 x 6         |

|        34 x 6         |



Create flags that indicate if each screen window needs to be redrawn

Check flags during vblank, draw them if they need to be redrawn

when printing characters in bottom window, add additional logic that checks if you're at the end of the last line.
if you are, shift the entire array vertical and resume at new line at bottom.

packet loggers should shift vertical too.

should anything go in the main loop rather than during vblank interrupt?

draw during vblank? read keyboard during vblank? read keyboard as fast as we can during main loop?
what would dos do? That is the question.
